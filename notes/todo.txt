create joined packet that notifies client which entity is its player

despawn entity packet

put constants in central place,
player config?
player move force mag

make a grouped packet


only apply input if seq number is larger, allow wrap around on server

udp data to send priority accumulator?

client improve sending code

expect when a send or listener send fails in listener.rs  expect when using any other channels  look into udp with tokio

client interest management

compartmentalize state->network, network->state, and state update code

a way to kick clients

udp with input packet ttl?




508 udp limit

<=1 thread per world/zone

    // error handling when sending
    // print message inconsistency

    // maybe just dont care about clean shutdowns, it takes way too much stuff?
    // it may be possible for notify to not work?

keep abort to shut down receiver and sender, it doesnt matter if it does something a tiny bit wierd, when it is already closing, dont make it more complicated??????
