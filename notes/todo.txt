when player joins it doesnt know entities exist until it gets an update

create joined packet that notifies client which entity is its player

despawn entity packet

auto reconnect?

put constants in central place,
player config?
player move force mag

refactor using bincode, turn of var ints

packet.rs needs to be standardized

packet.rs send, tick update block contains general code that needs to be separated

make a grouped packet

enum for unicast or multicast packet, making a vec for everything may be wasteful?????????

send_buf wierd name
